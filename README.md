## What is TensorFlow ?  
![Alt text](https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/1/11/TensorFlowLogo.svg/420px-TensorFlowLogo.svg.png?raw=true "Title")

TensorFlow is a free and open-source software library for dataflow and differentiable programming across a range of tasks. It is a symbolic math library, and is also used for machine learning applications such as neural networks.  
  
It was built to run on multiple CPUs or GPUs and even mobile operating systems, and it has several wrappers in several languages like Python, C++ or Java. 
  
## How does it work ?  
TensorFlow allows developers to create dataflow graphsâ€”structures that describe how data moves through a graph, or a series of processing nodes. Each node in the graph represents a mathematical operation, and each connection or edge between nodes is a multidimensional data array, or tensor.
